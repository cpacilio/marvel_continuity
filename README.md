## About
This repo keeps track of the reading order of Marvel comic books. 

It is not a comprehensive list: I'll take the freedom of skipping storylines that I do not bother about, if they are not strictly necessary to follow the other plots. 

Story lines are not necessarily in chronological order. Rather, they are listed in the order that preserves the smoothness of the reading. For example, sometimes I prefer reading a main event first and to catch up with its tie-ins only later. 

Other notable examples are the _Spider-Man: Back in black_ and _Spider-Man: One more day_ storylines. Since they deal with the aftermath of the Civil War on Spider-Man's life, I prefer to read them right after _Civil War_. But note that, since Spider-Man is a member of the New Avengers, he appears with the black suit in the Avengers titles right after the Civil War, as a consequence of the first issues of _Spider-Man: Back in black_. I opted to preserve the homogeneity in the reading of Spider-Man's storylines _Spider-Man: Back in black_ and _Spider-Man: One more day_ because they are not tie-ins of the Avengers ones and they tell a story that deserves to be appreciated without interruptions. After reading them, the reader can return to the Avengers plots and it will be super easy to figure out what is their relative timeline to Spider-Man.

#### Notes
- SM Ch.One #3 portrays the events of ASM #2 but it also reveals the truth behind the aliens, borrowing from the flaskback scenes originally portrayed in PPSSM #51.
- SM Ch.One #0 bortows the origins of the Vulture from ASM #241.
- ASM #136 contains a summary page with the events involving the marriage of Dr. Octopus and Aunt May and the war between Doc-Ock and Hammer-head. Since I find that the engagement of Aunt May with Doc-Ock is a regrettable sub-plot, I intentionally excluded all the related issues from my reading list. Luckily, ASM #136 can be easily read even without that page. There is also a one-ballon reference to Aunt May being guarded by Doc-Ock's guards during Gwen's funeral in ASM #123, however it is completely irrelevant to the scope of that issue.
- In PPSSM Annual #3, Peter works for the Bugle again.
- ASM Annual #13 has great art by John Byrne, and I love how Doc Ock's arms seem to be alive.
- ASM Annual #15 is a great comic book by any respect. Frank Miller's art is nearly perfect, and i love how Spider-Man's mask is drawn after Steve Ditko. It is a fine thrilling adventure cherried by a sarcasm on how sensational journalism work. It contains the best characterization of The Punisher so far. At the end, the Punisher lets himself to be atrested the Police. We'll see him next in Daredevil #182.
- PPSSM #76 happens between ASM #238 and 239.
- In PPSM #87-89 Peter goes open about his identity with the black cat; the black cat gets real super powers from kingpin; #88-89 are not present on MU.
- ASM #256 makes reference to the gang war between kingpin and Micah Synn in Daredevil.
- In PPSSM #99 the Black Cat gives a manifactured black suit to Peter.
- _The death of Jean deWolff_ is really a gem of a story
- ASM #277 is set during DD Born Again, After DD #228
- ASM #284-288 (_Gang War_) takes Place After DD: Love and War
- The main antagonist of the story-arc Torment SM #1-5 is Calypso. She was depicted as Kraven's partner and lover in AMS #209. There she had a manipulatory attitude towards Kraven, insisting on his pride to make him fight Spider-Man.
- After PPSSM #150, the events in WSM #51, PPSM #151, PPSSM #152, WSM #53, PPSSM #153, WSM #54, PPSSM #154, WSM #55 [not on MU] (_Gang War with Lobo Brothers, Robbie in prison_) occur. I found them boring.
- WSM #84-89 (_Name of the Rose_) [not on MU]. #84-86 takes Place before DD #300, after which Kingpin is set out of power from Hydra; Hobgoblin is in a bad shape after Ghost Rider #16-17 and Moonknight #32-33. Richard Fisk "dies" and the misterious Bloody Rose is born. I found these issues boring.
- Romita Jr's inks for SM are exceptional. 
- In PPSSM #237 Peter starts to regain his powers.
- In ASM #416 Peter is fired from the Bugle due to the journal's financial crisis. He still serves as a freelance for them.
- SM #70-71, 73-74 tells of the gang war following the Kingpin's loss of power and departure from New-York.
- _The Clone Saga_ is a controversial storyline occupying all Spider-Man titles between October 1994 and December 1996. It can be split in two parts (Oct 1994-to-Dec 1995 and Jan 1996-to-Dec 1996). I find that the first part is written in a chaotic way and only few issues are worth reading. The second part, on the other hand, is enjoyable and leads to what is probably the most important plot-twist in Spider-Man's history. Here is a brief summary of the first part, out of which I only list few selected issues:
  - Aunt May is hospitalized in critical conditions. On the rooftop of the hospital, Peter meets his clone, who he believed to be dead. He has lived out of New York for the past five years, under the name of Ben Reilly (_Spider-Man: The lost years #0-3_). Ben decides to stay in New York and assumes the secret identity of the Scarlet Spider. Meanwhile, a misterious foe named Kaine appears, who is revealed to be an earlier prototype of Peter's clone, whose cells are degenerating. Kaine, who is a much stronger and wilder version of Peter and Ben, kills Dr. Octopus. The Jackal makes his return as well. Aunt May dies, not before revealing to Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man since a long time (_ASM #400_). Meanwhile, Mary Jane gets pregnant. Peter and Ben check their genetic signatures with the help of Ben's friend, Dr. Seward Trainer. They discover that Peter is the clone while Ben is the original (_PPSSM #226_). A final battle leads to the deaths of the Jackal and Kaine. After the shocking revelations, Peter decides to leave New York and moves to Portland with Mary Jane (_PPSSM #229_). Ben is left as the only Spider-Man and starts a new life in New York.
- During the Clone Saga, we learn that five years have passed since the original Clone Saga. Moreover, in Spider-Man: Redemption, Flash Thompson tells Ben to be 25 years old. We deduce that Peter was approximately 19 when Gwen died and he is 25 during the Clone Saga.
- AMS-2 #12, PPSM-2 #12 Happen after DD-2 #7. There, a new Mysterio appears and his identity is kept secret up until the mini-series _Spider-Man: Mysterio Manifesto_. There he is hinted to be Daniel Berkhart, a second Mysterio originally appearing in AMS #141-142. I definitely disliked this mini-series.

### Classic Marvel Era (1961-)

__Early FF and Avengers:__

The FF are the first (and for a while the only) supergroup in the MU, the Avengers later followed up.

These stories are seminal in establishing the mithology of the MU. You will find the introduction of classic foes like the Skrulls, Dr Doom, The Watcher, Loki, and Kang The Conqueror. Moreover, directly from the Golden Age of Marvel Comics, Captain America is resurrected, alongside the Sub-Mariner.

These stories are 60 years old and have not always aged well: the plots might seem silly to a modern reader. Moreover, Sue Storm and women in general are often depicted as damsels in peril and lack a strong characterization.

- FF #2 (_Skrulls first appearance_)
- FF #4 (_Sub-Mariner awakens_)
- FF #5 (_Dr Doom first appearance_)
- FF #6 (_Sub-Mariner & Dr Doom_)
- FF #12 (_First meeting with the Hulk_)
- FF Annual #1 (_Origin of Sub-Mariner, Sub-Mariner conquers the Earth_)
- FF #18 (_Super Skrull_)
- FF #19 (_Pharoah Rama-Tut_)
- FF Annual #2 (_Origin of Dr Doom_)
- Avengers #3-4 (_Avengers vs Sub-Mariner & Hulk, Capt. America awakens_)
- Avengers #8 (_Kang the Conqueror_)
- AMS Annual #3 (_Avengers test SM on hunting for Hulk_)

__Roy Thomas' Avengers__:
- Avengers #56 (_Cap relives Bucky's death back in time_)
- Avengers #55, 57-58 (_Intro to Ultron and Vision, Vision joins the Avengers_) (you can read AMS #86 hereafter to know about the fate of the Black Widow)
- Avengers #87 (_Black Panther's origins_)
- Avengers #89-97 (_Kree-Skrull War_) (later issues figure amazing art by Neil Adams)
- Avengers #98-100 (_Ares vs Thor, Hercules, Vision falls in love with Wanda_)

### Marvel Knights

Black Panther (2005) #1-6

Sentry is a character that becomes pivotal and thoroughly explored in the New Avengers storylines from 2004 to 2010; these issues collect the original miniseries that established the character:

### X-Men Modern Era (2001 - )

In the Modern Era, X-Men comic books are best represented by two flagship titles: _New X-Men_ (2001-2004) by Grant Morrison and _Astonishing X-Men_ by Joss Whedon (2004-2008). Both runs can be read independently from other titles running in parallel (with the small exception of AXM #14, mentioning the appointment of Maria Hill as the new head of SHIELD after _Secret War_).

At the same time: _i._) 2004 marks the beginning of the event-centric era of Marvel Comics and all events mainly focus on the Avengers' storylines, and _ii._) nice X-Men stories happen in parallel with AXM. Therefore, when placed in continuity, AXM cannot be read straightly. 

Finally, Marvel decided to retcon some events shown in NXM (in particular the characters of Magneto and Xorn). Catching-up with Magneto requires reading the _Excalibur_ miniseries by Chris Claremont, which also serves as a prelude to the _House of M_ event, while _New Avengers_ #20 provides details about the fate of Xorn. 

I personally suggest to read Morrison's NXM and Whedon's AXM without interruptions. Once you have the overall perspective of these two excellent runs, you can read the other titles to fill-in the continuity and to enjoy many other nice runs.

- Civil War: the Sentinels guard the school, therefore it happens during decimation
- Phoenix: Warsong #1: we see the ``anime robot'' sentinels, therefore it's set after Civil: War X-Men.
- Astonishing X-Men #13: Maria Hill is deputy of Shield, therefore it happens after Secret War; the Sentinels do not guard the school 
- Giant Size Astonishing X-Men #1: the fate of Danger is left unknown (Danger comes back after Secret Invasion in X-Men Legacy #220)

#### Notes
- Marvel Knights Spider-Man #2: The Kingpin is considered decayed and The Owl is trying to take his place as the boss of the underground mob.
- New Avengers 11: 
  - Matt Murdock's identity is considered public and Matt Murdock says they want him in prison; 
  - Madame Hydra is considered in disgrace (but where did it happen?)
  - Wolverine is on a mission with the X-Men
- The Pulse #11-14:
  - The identity of Daredevil is unknown to the general public but is known to Ben Urich and I seem to understand that the FED's also know it
  - The so called Murdock files are mentioned
- During the Civil War, Dr. Strange and Wolverine are absent
- Captain America #28: Charles Xavier walks on his own legs and helps Tony stark with telepatic powers. Therefore it is set after _House of M_ and after _The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire_
