## About
This repo keeps track of the reading order of Marvel comic books. 

It is not a comprehensive list: I'll take the freedom of skipping storylines that I do not bother about, if they are not strictly necessary to follow the other plots. 

Story lines are not necessarily in chronological order. Rather, they are listed in the order that preserves the smoothness of the reading. For example, sometimes I prefer reading a main event first and to catch up with its tie-ins only later. 

Other notable examples are the _Spider-Man: Back in black_ and _Spider-Man: One more day_ storylines. Since they deal with the aftermath of the Civil War on Spider-Man's life, I prefer to read them right after _Civil War_. But note that, since Spider-Man is a member of the New Avengers, he appears with the black suit in the Avengers titles right after the Civil War, as a consequence of the first issues of _Spider-Man: Back in black_. I opted to preserve the homogeneity in the reading of Spider-Man's storylines _Spider-Man: Back in black_ and _Spider-Man: One more day_ because they are not tie-ins of the Avengers ones and they tell a story that deserves to be appreciated without interruptions. After reading them, the reader can return to the Avengers plots and it will be super easy to figure out what is their relative timeline to Spider-Man.

#### Notes
- SM Ch.One #3 portrays the events of ASM #2 but it also reveals the truth behind the aliens, borrowing from the flaskback scenes originally portrayed in PPSSM #51.
- SM Ch.One #0 bortows the origins of the Vulture from ASM #241.
- ASM #136 contains a summary page with the events involving the marriage of Dr. Octopus and Aunt May and the war between Doc-Ock and Hammer-head. Since I find that the engagement of Aunt May with Doc-Ock is a regrettable sub-plot, I intentionally excluded all the related issues from my reading list. Luckily, ASM #136 can be easily read even without that page. There is also a one-ballon reference to Aunt May being guarded by Doc-Ock's guards during Gwen's funeral in ASM #123, however it is completely irrelevant to the scope of that issue.
- in PPSSM Annual #3, Peter works for the Bugle again
- ASM Annual #13 has great art by John Byrne, and I love how Doc Ock's arms seem to be alive.
- ASM Annual #15 is a great comic book by any respect. Frank Miller's art is nearly perfect, and i love how Spider-Man's mask is drawn after Steve Ditko. It is a fine thrilling adventure cherried by a sarcasm on how sensational journalism work. It contains the best characterization of The Punisher so far. At the end, the Punisher lets himself to be atrested the Police. We'll see him next in Daredevil #182.
- PPSSM #76 happens between ASM #238 and 239.
- In PPSM #87-89 Peter goes open about his identity with the black cat; the black cat gets real super powers from kingpin; #88-89 are not present on MU.
- ASM #256 makes reference to the gang war between kingpin and micah synn in Daredevil.
- In PPSSM #99 the Black cat gives a manifactured balck suit to Peter.
- _The death of Jean deWolff_ is really a gem of a story
- ASM #277 Is set during DD Born Again, After DD #228
- ASM #284-288 (Gang War) takes Place After DD: Love and War
- The main antagonist of the story-arc Torment SM #1-5 is Calypso. She was depicted as Kraven's partner and lover in AMS #209. There she had a manipulatory attitude towards kraven, insisting on his pride to make him fight Spider-Man.

### X-Men Modern Era (2001 - )

In the Modern Era, X-Men comic books are best represented by two flagship titles: _New X-Men_ (2001-2004) by Grant Morrison and _Astonishing X-Men_ by Joss Whedon (2004-2008). Both runs can be read independently from other titles running in parallel (with the small exception of AXM #14, mentioning the appointment of Maria Hill as the new head of SHIELD after _Secret War_).

At the same time: _i._) 2004 marks the beginning of the event-centric era of Marvel Comics and all events mainly focus on the Avengers' storylines, and _ii._) nice X-Men stories happen in parallel with AXM. Therefore, when placed in continuity, AXM cannot be read straightly. 

Finally, Marvel decided to retcon some events shown in NXM (in particular the characters of Magneto and Xorn). Catching-up with Magneto requires reading the _Excalibur_ miniseries by Chris Claremont, which also serves as a prelude to the _House of M_ event, while _New Avengers_ #20 provides details about the fate of Xorn. 

I personally suggest to read Morrison's NXM and Whedon's AXM without interruptions. Once you have the overall perspective of these two excellent runs, you can read the other titles to fill-in the continuity and to enjoy many other nice runs.
