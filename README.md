  - Madame Hydra is considered in disgrace (but where did it happen?)
  - Wolverine is on a mission with the X-Men
- Young Avengers 1:
  - Jessica Jones is still pregnant
- New Avengers Illuminati #0:
  - The Illuminati decide to exile Hulk on another planet
- The Pulse #11-14:
  - The identity of Daredevil is unknown to the general public but is known to Ben Urich and I seem to understand that the FED's also know it
